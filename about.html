		-- This application simulates a cloud datastore management system. <br> -- The list of items on the left represents items 
		in a datastore (in this case AWS S3 Bucket).  <br>  -- Click "Refresh" to see the latest list of datastore items. <br>
		-- Clicking on a datastore item simulates a download or access of this item.  Information about the downloaded item is displayed the right side. <br>
		-- If an item is accessed 2 times within 5 seconds, a message is displayed to consider re-tiering the object.

		<strong id="implementationStrong">Implementation:</strong> <br> <br> This entire application is running in AWS.  This web UI is a simple static website hosted in AWS S3. 
		The back-end is a REST API microservice running in a docker container in AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).  The microservice
		uses Java Spring Boot and Spring Cloud technologies.  This UI makes asynchronous "AJAX" calls to the microservice REST API which interacts
		with the datastore to populate the various parts of the UI.  The microservice also contains the business-logic to recommend re-tiering if
		an item is accessed twice within 5 seconds.  <br> <br> 
		The microservice source code can be found on Github at  <a href="https://github.com/2-7-1/odd-command-dal">https://github.com/2-7-1/odd-command-dal</a> <br> <br>
